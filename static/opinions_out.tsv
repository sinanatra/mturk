4	I like the work - its relatively easy to do and I can do it on my time. My main issue is having the work available when I have time to do some of it. There are times where there are few HITs to do and its frustrating and a little angering to be honest.	Palm Springs, US	33.772179449999996	-116.49529769683983	AHV4U78TUUDKI
2	I really liked AMT years ago when I first started working for them. However, over the last year or so, this platform has really gone downhill. The hits are not worth my time. Sometimes they only pay a penny or so for work that is over five minutes long! Also, the rejecters seem to randomly reject work. I recently spent about 8 minutes explaining my response to a chatbot conversation, only to get rejected. I have no idea what they wanted. I have a master's, so I can get some good hits. However, these unfair rejections are really starting to add up, and I am worried I will lose my master's status once my rejection rate goes below 99%. What really hurt my rate was a "mass rejection" of 10 hits. It turns out that there was a glitch (I read it on MTURKOPTICON), but they would not reverse the rejections. That was so unfair when it was their fault.	Lima, US	40.741735	-84.1156539566922	AVOF14300525D
2	I like that I'm able work from home and not have to interact with other people, which helps since I have severe social anxiety. I dislike that the pay is very low. I also dislike that there aren't as many jobs/tasks being posted now as there were a few years ago, which makes it even more difficult to do it for income. The income is also not consistent, so you never really know how much you'll make in a given day or week.	Murray, US	36.6103334	-88.314761	A22KRF782ELLB0
4	I like that there is a place like this to be able to earn some extra money. I have been on here for almost 15 years and I would imagine that I will always use the service. So I like all of that. I wish there were more hits I qualify for sometimes, and that there was a better way to qualify for things. I am not sure how what else to say.	Knoxville, US	35.9603948	-83.9210261	A2UO3QJZNC2VOE
5	I value that i get insight into a hige huge variety of important studies and therein I learn some new things. Also, the extra money helps me a lot so overall I'll be positive about M-Turk. It's helped me a LOT over quite a few years by now.	Lawrence, US	38.9719137	-95.2359403	AUOYNTK0GOFOM
5	I am very happy to work with Amazon Mechanical Turk. I like to do hits lots. AMT is full fill my earnings is good. Amazon Mechanical Turk give lot of hits in future. now number of hits are very low quantiry	Salem, US	44.9391565	-123.033121	A33TFZWRGY3ASF
5	I once tried making some extra spending cash for my christmas shopping on Amazon and religiously visited the site multiple times a day, grabbing whatever I could and at the end of 3+ months, all I was able to amount to was ~$150. Not a good use of my time, if you ask me. I have better things to do in the time I invested in this thing.	Madurai, IN	9.9261153	78.1140983	AYCCX9AQMYUY8
4	It has gotten slow over the past three years.  Not as many jobs.  it use to have a lot more.  I could make 300 a week then but now it is much less than that.  I also think the AI devolplment is about done.	Shelby, US	35.2923513	-81.5356463	A1GKEEI844CEKI
2	Lacks any ability to truly hold requesters accountable. For the pay they offer, to unreasonable rejections. Amazon plays no role in defending the worker and leaves it up to us to just deal with it. Can try sending messages to requesters but often ignored. That includes wasting an hour on work to have it crash due to the requesters faulty software.	Pittsfield, US	43.306193	-71.324615	A2EI075XZT9Y2S
4	I like it well enough to have been doing it for more than 15 years, but it does have some real annoyances.  I don't like that bots are allowed to scrape HITs.  I don't like that there is no real repercussion when requesters have design flaws that waste worker time (like surveys with no confirmation code--this happens a LOT).  I also get annoyed that there is sometimes not enough work to do.  Overall, though, I find it a convenient way to supplement my income at times that work for me.	Gretna, US	29.9146493	-90.0539604	ADAGUJNWMEPT6
4	despite some drawbacks; finding out about m-turk is one of the best things that has happened to me.  when i had a job,m-turk earnings were an excellent source of secondary income. now that i am retired, m-turk income, combined with my social security and pension provide me with a relatively comfortable living although i am far from wealthy.  i can do m-turk hits whenever i want; i don't have to worry about my wardrobe; no one is telling me what to do or how to do it.  i like that my approval rating is 99.89 because that tells me i'm doing almost all hits the way they are supposed to be done.  i don't like however, that too many requesters don't seem to know the best ways to produce hits. for example, too many requesters do not allow enough time. these requesters apparently don't know that once time has expired, it can not be extended.  the rates of pay some requesters offer are absurd.  for example, 10 cents for a 10 minute hit.  that is far from acceptable.  when the time that a hit is supposed to take is not even listed.  for example, i might be willing to do a 25 cent hit but i need to know how long the hit will take.	Undefined, US	43.4911326	-74.9481252	A1S88VQY8G8CNC
3	It's an easy way to earn small amounts of money. I've been doing it for about 13 years, and it helped me pay off my mortgage. On the downside, though, the work can be difficult to find and some of the HITs are tedious.  Amazon doesn't support Turkers at all and so we're pretty much at the mercy of anyone who wants to scam us, steal our work and not pay us.  The work is so variable - definitely feast or famine - and I'm glad I don't rely on it for anything important anymore.	Saint Paul, US	44.9497487	-93.0931028	AKX5RHHO8BIUX
1	it is very good platform, it is very helpful to change my life, now a days hits are very low, my finiancial problem critical, please give some more works.amt is very nice and honesty earning	Undefined, IN	10.9301522	78.08485454572889	A3CJVRJ34U70Y9
4	I like the opportunity to earn money from completing HITs on Amazon Mechanical Turk. I particularly like the academic surveys. I dislike the HITs with very low payments. I dislike when there are a large number of HITs from the same requestor instead of listing all of these HITs under a single post.	Undefined, US	40.2414952	-75.2837862	A26ZENZ5G8AEGM
3	I like the platform when things are working and the work is paid.  Unfortunately, there are some hits that reject hits for no reason and we have no way to dispute the issue.  I understand there are millions of hits yearly but if a requestor is being deceitful or has a really low acceptance rate there needs to be an investigation and workers should be made whole.	Undefined, CA	53.5193105	-114.1385071	A2J65ZHAJQDKAC
3	On one hand, mturk changed my life. I have C-PTSD and find public places too noisy and stressful. I was on the verge of becoming completely homeless but went back to working on here (I previously worked a lot on here when in college but then took a break). It now gives me a chance to earn enough money to survive. On the other hand, it's a terrible way to make a living. It's not stable and can be stressful. I have found that working on other platforms and bouncing back and forth between them helps so there isn't as much down time waiting for work.	Denver, US	39.7392364	-104.984862	A205YOMVOVCUY4
5	I love this platform. It gives me the opportunity to make a little bit of money whenever I have time. I feel I have input in social issues when filling out surveys.	Tucson, US	32.2228765	-110.974847	A2WMSIPUKEIBNS

5	Amazon Mechanical Turk is a great platform for me. Presently, I maintain 97.84% and  45,632 approved hits. So when I work consistently, I can earn 10$ per day for 8 hours. But nowadays I don't get more hits. I don't know the reason.  Anyhow I am happy while working in this platform. Thank you MTURK..	Coonoor, IN	11.344238	76.8016516	A3I9CPE69O3INJ

4	Yes I generally love Amazon Mechanical Turk platform due to the fact that it has enabled me get earn extra income; something that I initially lacked. I am also more engaged with no time to idle and have negative thoughts. But I also have my own misgivings about the platform. Some requesters pay so little yet demand so much. Additionally, there are times when there are little to no work on the platform.	Dallas, US	32.7762719	-96.7968559	A3BGT9U8N01FU1

3	I can do it on my own time. I don't have a boss, I can do it from home. The pay is low, and there's some just BS stuff that you have to wade through(like some surveys that pay virtually nothing for half an hour).

5	To be quite honest, I think that working on the Amazon Mechanical Turk Platform is a great way to relieve stress and improve my finances. The AMT work questionnaires regarding gaming and family matters are my favorites. To be honest, I think AMT's work is fine. My daily life is nice, but in one terrible circumstance, I am completely destroyed. Amazon Mechanical Turk was incredibly useful at the time. I have always enjoyed and cherished AMT work. I consider my work as an AMT to be really unique.	Daytona Beach, US	29.2108147	-81.0228331	A3TSNJGVTSTP3

4	I like working on the Amazon Mechanical Turk Platform. It's a good way to earn some extra funds, though I do wish there were more higher paying surveys I could sign up for.

1	Mturk is no longer what it should be! It would be desirable, to stop this mess and horrible discrimination, called "master qualification", and to give equal chances to all mturk workers to participate in mturk studies! It is a shame that while we brag about democracy, we still use such discriminatory practices! Do you think that a "master" is smarter or more intelligent than a "non-master"?

5	I really like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform because through some pleasant, pleasant and interesting tasks, in addition to earning something it allows you to learn new things and learn new topics that perhaps you would know nothing about. I discovered the platform by chance, browsing the internet and it was a pleasant discovery.	Roma, IT	41.8933203	12.4829321	ADFNJKG7WPUX2
4	I like Amazon Mechanical Turk because it provides me a way to make an additional income. I don't like that in order to make a reasonable amount of money that I have to login during the day sporadically to check for new HITs. It would be nice if I could work on those HITs later at night. The work is hit and miss sometimes and not very reliable.	Fuquay-Varina, US	35.5843849	-78.7998691	A1QWQI2ZV6TFOB

2	my feelings are mixed. it nice in that I can work on it my time, a simple way to make a bit small earnings, and relatively easy to use. the other, the MTURK and surveys has multiple flaws, sometimes the time/payouts are not fair. and the overall experience is getting worse from a couple of years ago.

5	Working on the Amazon Mechanical Turk Platform has been extremely beneficial to my financial well-being and stress relief. I like the AMT job survey on gaming and family-related questionnaires. To be honest, I do not dislike AMT's work. My everyday life is excellent, but in one unpleasant event, I am completely broken. Amazon Mechanical Turk was very useful at the time. I have always enjoyed and appreciated AMT work. AMT work holds a particular place in my heart.	Miami, US	25.7741728	-80.19362	ACZLEW8JE4L7E

2	It's the only genuine and straightforward online work platform that i know of even though it doesn't pay much on many tasks. I wish it paid more and gave me more tasks but they don't seem to really care about us. But american workers are paid well and about 10 times as much as Indian workers. That is sad.

4	In general, I like AMT, mostly because I've discovered one HIT that usually pays off.  But I HATE it when I get tricked, with a HIT where the time automatically runs out before the 'time allotted.'	Atlanta, US	33.7489924	-84.3902644	A39K4JNYDU0QMJ
3	I do like it. I work on it just to earn a little bit of extra pocket money. Nice to make a few bucks a day without leaving the house. Just wish it had more jobs or higher paying jobs or an easier way to qualify for better jobs.	Hendersonville, US	35.3187279	-82.4609528	A1EJ8KMQXV9DRU
5	what i like about AMT is that it gives me the option to work remotely from home . all i need is a PC with internet connection. second thing i like is atleast some work is available throughout the day, so i can work when ever i feel like. third thing i like is i get payed in US dollars which are equivalent of huge amount of Indian rupees. what i don't like is that whenever after getting a rejection i try to contact requester most of the times they don't reply at all. that is so unprofessional attitude. second thing i hate is that most work is available to US citizens only . i think even indian workers are of same  competency. one honest suggestion of mine is instead of focussing only on micro gigs , AMT should also provide bigger assignment options as well. also, if AMT can also cover transaction fees and annual maintenance fee of payment processors like hyperwallet and payoneer then we can see some real earnings entering our bank accounts and would give workers a lot of mental peace and would truly increase the bonding between AMT and it's workers.	Gurugram District, IN	28.42826235	77.00270014657752	A23THREOGHZVDF
3	I am disappointed that AMT has changed so drastically in the past year in that good paying surveys are very hard to find and the work that is offered offers such small rewards so that the work-reward ratio is skewed is so low as opposed to the recent past.

5	In short, if you treat Amazon Mechanical Turk like a full-time job, then it's possible to earn a full-time living. In fact, it isn't uncommon for top workers to make over $100 a day. While it won't be the highest-paying work from home job, it's possible to consistently make money online from MTurk	Undefined, US	31.2638905	-98.5456116	A1VNLG8WJS0FB0
3	Although Amazon Turk is a secondary means to make income, there should be more high paying tasks to complete than competing with others for low paying tasks. I make money on Amazon Turk because I am a stay at home mother at the moment taking care of a disabled son, therefore I utilize Amazon Turk as a way to make ends meet. I do enjoy the option of working at will on Amazon Turk, but the low pay is definitely a determining factor as to why I am currently searching for a much higher paying work from home job.

4	I like the platform. It is a hobby for me, and I do not depend on it for much income, I use it for "treats money".  That being said, many of the payouts are too low for the time, it would be nice if there were minimum payouts based on projected time to complete a task.

3	Finding work on AMT came at a time where I needed extra funds while working towards the goal of publishing my first book. Since that time I have found AMT to be convenient and a spare source of income that helps me. I enjoy the academic HITS the most and have learned quite a bit from surveys that require writing, keeping a diary, and those asking about politics. I only wish there were more HITS and have since began working for Branded Surveys.	Salt Lake City, US	40.7596198	-111.886797	A39GP79ULCP9J2

1	I don't like Mechanical Turk because I find it extremely stressful. I feel a constant need to be monitoring the site for work and there's not enough work to go around. It feels like I'm always required to be checking on the tasks that are being released and I feel pressure that I need to be among the first workers to start a batch so that the work won't dry up and to ensure that I'll get paid for my efforts. I work on Mechanical Turk because I don't feel I have enough money to be able to cut the platform out entirely.	City of New York, US	40.7127281	-74.0060152	A345TDMHP3DQ3G
4	I think there are a lot of positives with the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform.  I like how the dashboard is laid out.  I like the option of getting paid every 3 days.  I like the sorting features. I like that you can apply for certain types of surveys and studies. I like how there seem to always be one or two HITs where you can go in most hours of the day and be able to choose a lower-paying survey so that you aren't completely wasting your time.  I own a small business that is very seasonal. I've started AMT to supplement that income a bit and help level it out during slow times. It seems to fit that niche well.

5	My honest opinions about working on the Amazon Mechanical Turk Platform are that it is both financially beneficial and stress-reducing. I really enjoy the AMT work survey on gaming and family-related questionnaires. To be really honest, I don't dislike AMT's work. My daily life is nice, but one awful circumstance has completely devastated me. At the time, Amazon Mechanical Turk was quite useful. I've always liked and enjoyed AMT job.
