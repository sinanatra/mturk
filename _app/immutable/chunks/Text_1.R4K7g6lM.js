    Before creating an account on the platform, I watched a couple of YouTube
    videos and read on Reddit how to set up tasks. Most of the examples and
    discussions I encountered were about machine learning and the amount of
    money you can earn on Mechanical Turk, and what is the right payment per
    task. On average, Amazon Mechanical Turk pays between $1 and $6 per hour.

    Since I intended to collect photos of the view from workers&#39; windows, I had
    to structure the task and link it to a Google form. Amazon Mechanical Turk
    does not allow photos to be uploaded directly and this is one of the most
    common approaches suggested on Reddit. A Google form allowed participants to
    upload a photo, write their city of origin and their Amazon Mechanical Turk
    ID. This way, after completing the questionnaire, they could receive a
    password to enter into MTurk to get the reward. With the first experiment, I
    collected 203 pictures. The initial goal was 100. More than 50% of the
    images did not comply with the request. In some cases these were broken
    files, in others desktop screenshots, photos of animals or stock images.
    Quite a few entries were duplicated to collect extra rewards.
