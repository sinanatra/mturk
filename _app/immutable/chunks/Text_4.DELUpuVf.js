        Why do you do it? Please share your honest feelings and opinions on the
        platform.</h2> <p>This time I repeated the task twice, by asking what are the feelings and
        opinion of the workers on the platform. The first time it was open to
        all workers on the platform, and the second time only to Mechanical Turk
        &quot;Masters.&quot;</p> <figure><img src="masters.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"/> <figcaption>“Mechanical Turk has built technology which analyzes Worker
            performance, identifies high performing Workers, and monitors their
            performance over time. Workers who have demonstrated excellence
            across a wide range of tasks are awarded the Masters Qualification.
            Masters must continue to pass our statistical monitoring to retain
            the Mechanical Turk Masters Qualification.”</figcaption></figure> <p>The hiring of Masters involves a different fee charged by Mturks, which
        is $0.005 compared to $0.040.

        contrast, after 3 days I closed the task for &quot;masters&quot; only with only 17
        submissions. The quality of these entries is definitely higher, with
        responses such as:</p> <quote>“I really liked AMT years ago when I first started working for them.
        However, over the last year or so, this platform has really gone
        downhill. The hits are not worth my time. Sometimes they only pay a
        penny or so for work that is over five minutes long! Also, the rejecters
        seem to randomly reject work. I recently spent about 8 minutes
        explaining my response to a chatbot conversation, only to get rejected.
        I have no idea what they wanted. I have a master&#39;s, so I can get some
        good hits. However, these unfair rejections are really starting to add
        up, and I am worried I will lose my master&#39;s status once my rejection
        rate goes below 99%. What really hurt my rate was a &quot;mass rejection&quot; of
        10 hits. It turns out that there was a glitch (I read it on
        MTURKOPTICON), but they would not reverse the rejections. That was so
        unfair when it was their fault.”.</quote> <p>However, it is clear that there is a lack of such workers. In addition,
        as already commented with the previous exercise and description above,
        several workers have complained about the unexplained rejections that
        often occur in the platform.</p>`;return{c(){e=l("section"),e.innerHTML=s,this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(e)!=="svelte-1r0oits"&&(e.innerHTML=s),this.h()},h(){f(e,"class","desc svelte-1gua0zx")},m(t,r){m(t,e,r)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&d(e)}}}class y extends n{constructor(e){super(),h(this,e,null,p,i,{})}}export{y as T};
