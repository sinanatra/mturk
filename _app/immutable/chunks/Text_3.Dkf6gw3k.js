        extra ones were mainly the example image I provided. By default, Amazon
        Mechanical Turk automatically approves submissions after a period of
        three days. This is probably why most of the material submitted does not
        comply with the task. Quickly completed tasks in order to collect a
        reward that is hopefully not checked. With a dataset of a few hundred
        images, I can check each entry one by one, and in those three days I can
        reject entries that are &#39;wrong&#39; by selecting the specific entry and
        writing a few words in a textarea.</p> <figure><img src="./rejection.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1tunlep"/> <figcaption>Screenshot of the rejection form.</figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BKUpKvUYFcbuOopOiwEoRo2_9SOEaybF" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1tunlep"/> <figcaption>The sample image, or screenshots of it appear multiple times as
            submissions.</figcaption></figure> <p>However, the submitted material remains with me. I can still use it and
        the additional, but inaccurate, data I collect is free work. The review
        process does not seem to be transparent. For all the assignments I have
        refused so far, no worker has ever replied to me asking for an
        explanation. I therefore wonder how many institutions exploit this
        system, refusing payment but continuing to collect tagged data for free.
        At the same time, if usually a third or half of the data collected is
        junk, where does this random content end up?</p>`;return{c(){e=l("section"),e.innerHTML=s,this.h()},l(t){e=h(t,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(e)!=="svelte-xf8x6g"&&(e.innerHTML=s),this.h()},h(){f(e,"class","desc svelte-1tunlep")},m(t,o){m(t,e,o)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&u(e)}}}class w extends n{constructor(e){super(),c(this,e,null,g,r,{})}}export{w as T};
