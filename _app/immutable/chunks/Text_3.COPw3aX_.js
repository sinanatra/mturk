        their working setup. Here are the photos I received and the city they
        were sent from.</h2> <figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17q1w5g-NpNtT2LAPYULfyvQeNt_9hLC3" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"/> <figcaption>Kozhikode, IN</figcaption></figure> <p>After more than one year from the first experiment, I logged into the
        platform this time asking for photos of work desks, giving this as an
        example:</p> <figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/oVphOAZ7pHj4qq8gx14SBRoW55DrcPPucsQ-3p4jFmYSSsYPZEivlfe106BQmdcirjJCggSr1zOLPvrR4HcPn3JRsILB4L4FKPYtPkkUJfhrCEnawb7OvLb9ApWTkcHG_IIQSX0T8OtTys8T_VcFqmOtn6tvWw" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"/> <figcaption>My reference image.</figcaption></figure> <p>This is the first contribution I received.</p> <figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u/0/drive-viewer/AKGpihat1-geWLTBK7rU1llv0nY-VJlng7nObjrCLeLey-TAB_1o6wuT6FXBXgFylM2PqDhR5Nyp9Vl4qWuN3KXEJsyC05zIFONShCo=w1331-h978-v0" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"/> <figcaption>Location: US</figcaption></figure> <p>Again, I asked for 100 images and collected 140 at the end, where the
        extra ones were mainly the example image I provided. By default, Amazon
        Mechanical Turk automatically approves submissions after a period of
        three days. This is probably why most of the material submitted does not
        comply with the task. Quickly completed tasks in order to collect a
        reward that is hopefully not checked. With a dataset of a few hundred
        images, I can check each entry one by one, and in those three days I can
        reject entries that are &#39;wrong&#39; by selecting the specific entry and
        writing a few words in a textarea.</p> <figure><img src="./rejection.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"/> <figcaption>Screenshot of the rejection form.</figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BKUpKvUYFcbuOopOiwEoRo2_9SOEaybF" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"/> <figcaption>The sample image, or screenshots of it appear multiple times as
            submissions.</figcaption></figure> <p>However, the submitted material remains with me. I can still use it and
        the additional, but inaccurate, data I collect is free labour. The review
        process does not seem to be transparent. For all the assignments I have
        refused so far, no worker has ever replied to me asking for an
        explanation. I therefore wonder how many institutions exploit this
        system, refusing payment but continuing to collect tagged data for free.
        At the same time, if usually a third or half of the data collected is
        junk, where does this random content end up?</p>`;return{c(){e=n("section"),e.innerHTML=i,this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(e)!=="svelte-12twtad"&&(e.innerHTML=i),this.h()},h(){h(e,"class","desc svelte-1gua0zx")},m(t,o){g(t,e,o)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&p(e)}}}class y extends u{constructor(e){super(),f(this,e,null,m,r,{})}}export{y as T};
