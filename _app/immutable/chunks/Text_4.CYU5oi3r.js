        feelings and opinions on the platform. What do they like and detest? And
        why do they work on Mturk.</h2> <p>This time I repeated the task twice, the first time it was open to all
        workers on the platform, and the second time only to Mechanical Turk
        &quot;Masters.&quot;</p> <quote>“Mechanical Turk has built technology which analyzes Worker performance,
        identifies high performing Workers, and monitors their performance over
        time. Workers who have demonstrated excellence across a wide range of
        tasks are awarded the Masters Qualification. Masters must continue to
        pass our statistical monitoring to retain the Mechanical Turk Masters
        Qualification.”</quote> <p>The hiring of Masters involves a different fee charged by Mturks, which
        is $0.005 compared to $0.040. In less than an hour, the first part of
        the new task was completed. In contrast, after 3 days I closed the task
        for &quot;masters&quot; only with only 17 submissions. The quality of these
        entries is definitely higher, with responses such as:</p> <quote>“I really liked AMT years ago when I first started working for them.
        However, over the last year or so, this platform has really gone
        downhill. The hits are not worth my time. Sometimes they only pay a
        penny or so for work that is over five minutes long! Also, the rejecters
        seem to randomly reject work. I recently spent about 8 minutes
        explaining my response to a chatbot conversation, only to get rejected.
        I have no idea what they wanted. I have a master&#39;s, so I can get some
        good hits. However, these unfair rejections are really starting to add
        up, and I am worried I will lose my master&#39;s status once my rejection
        rate goes below 99%. What really hurt my rate was a &quot;mass rejection&quot; of
        10 hits. It turns out that there was a glitch (I read it on
        MTURKOPTICON), but they would not reverse the rejections. That was so
        unfair when it was their fault.”.</quote> <p>However, it is clear that there is a lack of such workers. In addition,
        as already commented with the previous exercise and description above,
        several workers have complained about the unexplained rejections that
        often occur in the platform.</p>`;return{c(){e=l("section"),e.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(e)!=="svelte-sphuew"&&(e.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){d(e,"class","desc svelte-1gua0zx")},m(t,r){m(t,e,r)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&f(e)}}}class k extends i{constructor(e){super(),h(this,e,null,p,n,{})}}export{k as T};
