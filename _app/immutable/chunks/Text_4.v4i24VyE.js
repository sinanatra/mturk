        Why do you do it? Please share your honest feelings and opinions on the
        platform.</h2> <p>This time I repeated the task twice, by asking what are the feelings and
        opinion of the workers on the platform. The first time it was open to
        all workers on the platform, and the second time only to Mechanical Turk
        &quot;Masters.&quot;</p> <figure><img src="masters.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"/> <figcaption>“Mechanical Turk has built technology which analyzes Worker
            performance, identifies high performing Workers, and monitors their
            performance over time. Workers who have demonstrated excellence
            across a wide range of tasks are awarded the Masters Qualification.
            Masters must continue to pass our statistical monitoring to retain
            the Mechanical Turk Masters Qualification.”</figcaption></figure> <p>The hiring of Masters involves a different fee charged by Mturks, which
        is $0.005 compared to $0.040.

        contrast, after 3 days I closed the task for &quot;masters&quot; only with only 17
        submissions. The quality of these entries is definitely higher, with
        responses such as:</p> <quote>“On one hand, mturk changed my life. I have C-PTSD and find public
        places too noisy and stressful. I was on the verge of becoming
        completely homeless but went back to working on here (I previously
        worked a lot on here when in college but then took a break). It now
        gives me a chance to earn enough money to survive. On the other hand,
        it&#39;s a terrible way to make a living. It&#39;s not stable and can be
        stressful. I have found that working on other platforms and bouncing
        back and forth between them helps so there isn&#39;t as much down time
        waiting for work”.</quote> <p>However, it is clear that there is a lack of such workers. In addition,
        as already commented with the previous exercise and description above,
        several workers have complained about the unexplained rejections that
        often occur in the platform.</p>`;return{c(){e=l("section"),e.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(e)!=="svelte-17zkj9p"&&(e.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){f(e,"class","desc svelte-1gua0zx")},m(t,n){d(t,e,n)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&p(e)}}}class w extends r{constructor(e){super(),h(this,e,null,m,i,{})}}export{w as T};
