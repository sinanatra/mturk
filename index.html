        large groups of individuals to participate in creating, tagging and
        describing data.
        <br>
        Introduced by Amazon in 2005, Mechanical Turk is named after an 18th century
        “automatic” chess-playing machine, which was handily beating humans in chess
        games. Of course, the robot was not using any artificial intelligence algorithms
        back then. The secret of the Mechanical Turk machine was a human operator,
        hidden inside the machine,who was the real intelligence.
        <sup class="svelte-1siny65"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1869086.1869094" target="_blank" class="svelte-1siny65">1</a></sup> <br><br>
        Today, Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace for tasks that cannot be easily
        automated, which are then fulfilled by human users. Such tasks, mainly involve
        the creation of datasets: collections of data that act as pedagogical learning
        material when dealing with Artificial intelligences, most specifically, machine
        learning systems. Current Artificial intelligences are in fact able to &quot;learn”
        to execute such tasks by simply repeatedly analysing large numbers of labelled
        examples and counterexamples.
        <br>
        Such data is analysed and processed by workers on platforms like Mechanical
        Turks. But little is known about these individuals that complete these tasks.</p> <figure><img src="./interface.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1siny65"> <figcaption>Main page of the platform.</figcaption></figure> <quote>“The view is partially blocked by a large hedge/bush of some sort. There
        are large deciduous trees off in the distance, and what appears to be an
        overcast sky. In the far right window pane there is a flowering bush
        with pink flowers.”</quote> <p>On July 02, 2022 I uploaded 200 images on Amazon Mechanical Turkand I
        asked the workers on the platform to describe what they saw. The
        description above is one of the hundreds that I received in less than an
        hour.</p> <div><quote>Houses and trees.</quote></div> <div><quote style="text-align: center; display:block">NICE PHOTO.</quote></div> <div><quote style="text-align: right; display:block">A bike and some trees.  </quote></div> <div><quote style="text-align: center; display:block">GARDEN.</quote></div> <div><quote style="text-align: left; display:block">I see calm days, quiet place with some parked cars.</quote></div> <div><quote style="text-align: right; display:block">car</quote></div> <p>The images that have been described are a result of the same process. On
        June 16, 2022, I started this experiment by asking the workers at Amazon
        Mechanical Turk to send me a photo of their view out of the window and
        the city they live in for $0.20.</p> <p>As organisations use Mechanical Turk to create datasets, in these
        experiments more private dataseta have been created. Following the logic
        of the platform, for a small fee workers have been asked to show a
        glimpse of their private life, their view close to their desk, their
        working station. At the limit of ethics and labour exploitation I asked
        myself whether this is an acceptable approach to use in research and in
        general, if employing random workers around the world is the ideal
        practice to shape future artificial intelligences.</p> <p>While both tasks were performed, the material collected varied
        considerably: from blurred photos to details of curtains, from
        landscapes to computer screenshots.</p> <p>The same consideration can be made with the texts collected. Some
        descriptions are lengthy, others are short, some are tags, others
        instead are just typos. Following the idea that when talking about a
        technology one has to place oneself within it, becoming a &#39;Requester&#39; on
        Amazon Mechanical Turk allowed me to find out more about how the system
        works, the review process and the quality of the data collected.</p> <p>Although much is documented about the demographics of the platform and
        the fact that different payments do not affect the quality of the
        results, these &#39;results&#39; are rarely visible. Most of the data collected
        did not reflect the assigned task. Many results were gibberish, or when
        asked to upload a photo, these were often desktop screenshots, stock
        images, or photos on the computer. These rebellious approaches to the
        platform allow workers to collect their rewards easily and can be
        ignored by requesters. For this reason, such datasets are shown in their
        entirety on this site.</p> <quote>“Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about
        somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediaxted by
        networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in
        physical, material places”.
        <sup class="svelte-1siny65"><a href="https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.8" target="_blank" class="svelte-1siny65">2</a></sup></quote> <p>Datasets are no exception. The information they carry is a reflection of
        time, politics and geographical contexts.
        <br>
        Although, in the past years, there has been a growing attention of bias studies
        in the field of machine learning, there is still a general disinterest for
        the ones carried by the hidden geographies of datasets. Consequentyl, a central
        focus is on the geographies of Amazon Mechanical Turk. Not necessarly on
        the demographics of its workers, but rather on the different places where
        data is annotated and created.
        <br></p> </section></div> <a href="views" class="svelte-4mwio5"><section class="desc svelte-1gua0zx" data-svelte-h="svelte-1usbziz"><h1>Views from outside the window</h1> <h2>I asked the workers at Amazon Mechanical Turk to send me a photo of
        their view out of the window for $0.20. Here are the photos I received
        and the city they were sent from.</h2>

    Before creating an account on the platform, I watched a couple of YouTube
    videos and read on Reddit how to set up tasks. Most of the examples and
    discussions I encountered were about machine learning and the amount of
    money you can earn on Mechanical Turk, and what is the right payment per
    task. On average, Amazon Mechanical Turk pays between $1 and $6 per hour.
    <figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nXpH7sGJT4E8r6e5k9UWCMJY-j8yh9TC" alt="view from Sarasota,us" class="svelte-1gua0zx"> <figcaption>View from Sarasota,US</figcaption></figure>

    Since I intended to collect photos of the view from workers&#39; windows, I had
    to structure the task and link it to a Google form. Amazon Mechanical Turk
    does not allow photos to be uploaded directly and this is one of the most
    common approaches suggested on Reddit. A Google form allowed participants to
    upload a photo, write their city of origin and their Amazon Mechanical Turk
    ID. This way, after completing the questionnaire, they could receive a
    password to enter into MTurk to get the reward. With the first experiment, I
    collected 203 pictures. The initial goal was 100. More than 50% of the
    images did not comply with the request. In some cases these were broken
    files, in others desktop screenshots, photos of animals or stock images.
    Quite a few entries were duplicated to collect extra rewards.

        extra ones were mainly the example image I provided. By default, Amazon
        Mechanical Turk automatically approves submissions after a period of
        three days. This is probably why most of the material submitted does not
        comply with the task. Quickly completed tasks in order to collect a
        reward that is hopefully not checked. With a dataset of a few hundred
        images, I can check each entry one by one, and in those three days I can
        reject entries that are &#39;wrong&#39; by selecting the specific entry and
        writing a few words in a textarea.</p> <figure><img src="./rejection.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"> <figcaption>Screenshot of the rejection form.</figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BKUpKvUYFcbuOopOiwEoRo2_9SOEaybF" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"> <figcaption>The sample image, or screenshots of it appear multiple times as
            submissions.</figcaption></figure> <p>However, the submitted material remains with me. I can still use it and
        the additional, but inaccurate, data I collect is free labour. The review
        process does not seem to be transparent. For all the assignments I have
        refused so far, no worker has ever replied to me asking for an
        explanation. I therefore wonder how many institutions exploit this
        system, refusing payment but continuing to collect tagged data for free.
        At the same time, if usually a third or half of the data collected is
        junk, where does this random content end up?</p> </section></a> <a href="opinions" style="--color-1:#aec8ac" class="svelte-4mwio5"><section class="desc svelte-1gua0zx" data-svelte-h="svelte-l5jz9i"><h1>Opinions of the workers</h1> <h2>What do you like and detest about working for Amazon Mechanical Turk?
        Why do you do it? Please share your honest feelings and opinions on the
        platform.</h2> <p>This time I repeated the task twice, by asking what are the feelings and
        opinion of the workers on the platform. The first time it was open to
        all workers on the platform, and the second time only to Mechanical Turk
        &quot;Masters.&quot;</p> <figure><img src="masters.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"> <figcaption>“Mechanical Turk has built technology which analyzes Worker

            Masters must continue to pass our statistical monitoring to retain
            the Mechanical Turk Masters Qualification.”</figcaption></figure> <p>The hiring of Masters involves a different fee charged by Mturks, which
        is $0.005 compared to $0.040.
        <figure><img src="fees.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1gua0zx"> <figcaption>A screenshot showing the fees of the plaftorm.</figcaption></figure></p> <p>In less than an hour, the first part of the new task was completed. In
        contrast, after 3 days I closed the task for &quot;masters&quot; only with only 17
        submissions. The quality of these entries is definitely higher, with
        responses such as:</p> <quote>“On one hand, mturk changed my life. I have C-PTSD and find public
        places too noisy and stressful. I was on the verge of becoming
        completely homeless but went back to working on here (I previously
        worked a lot on here when in college but then took a break). It now
        gives me a chance to earn enough money to survive. On the other hand,
        it&#39;s a terrible way to make a living. It&#39;s not stable and can be
        stressful. I have found that working on other platforms and bouncing
        back and forth between them helps so there isn&#39;t as much down time
        waiting for work”.</quote> <p>However, it is clear that there is a lack of such workers. In addition,
        as already commented with the previous exercise and description above,
        several workers have complained about the unexplained rejections that
        often occur in the platform.</p> <quote>Lacks any ability to truly hold requesters accountable. For the pay they
        offer, to unreasonable rejections. Amazon plays no role in defending the
        worker and leaves it up to us to just deal with it. Can try sending
        messages to requesters but often ignored. That includes wasting an hour
        on work to have it crash due to the requesters faulty software.</quote> <quote>I really liked AMT years ago when I first started working for them.
        However, over the last year or so, this platform has really gone
        downhill. The hits are not worth my time. Sometimes they only pay a
        penny or so for work that is over five minutes long! Also, the rejecters
        seem to randomly reject work. I recently spent about 8 minutes
        explaining my response to a chatbot conversation, only to get rejected.
        I have no idea what they wanted. I have a master&#39;s, so I can get some
        good hits. However, these unfair rejections are really starting to add
        up, and I am worried I will lose my master&#39;s status once my rejection
        rate goes below 99%. What really hurt my rate was a &quot;mass rejection&quot; of
        10 hits. It turns out that there was a glitch (I read it on
        MTURKOPTICON), but they would not reverse the rejections. That was so
        unfair when it was their fault.</quote> </section></a> <div style="--color-1:#c2c2c2" class="svelte-4mwio5"><section class="desc svelte-9q0th3" data-svelte-h="svelte-ahvf63"><h1>Trying to work for Amazon Mechanical Turk</h1> <h2>I am desperately trying to create a worker account to earn back what I
