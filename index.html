        workers. Following the logic of the platform, workers have been employed
        for a small fee and asked to give a glimpse of their private lifes.
        Unlike the typical use of the platform, the submitted data prompt
        reflection on hidden labor, material quality, and ways of rebelling
        against a system on the verge of ethics.</h2> <figure><img src="./mturk.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1tunlep"> <figcaption>Drawing of von Kempelen&#39;s Mechanical Turk (Villatoro 2013).</figcaption></figure> <p>The ever-growing use of platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, allow
        large groups of individuals to participate in creating, tagging and
        describing data.
        <br>
        Introduced by Amazon in 2005, Mechanical Turk is named after an 18th century
        “automatic” chess-playing machine, which was handily beating humans in chess
        games. Of course, the robot was not using any artificial intelligence algorithms
        back then. The secret of the Mechanical Turk machine was a human operator,
        hidden inside the machine, who was the real intelligence (Ipeirotis, 2010).
        <br><br>

        Today, Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace for tasks that cannot be
        easily automated, which are then fulfilled by human users. Such tasks,
        mainly involve the creation of datasets: collections of data that act as
        pedagogical learning material when dealing with Artificial
        intelligences, most specifically, machine learning systems. Current
        Artificial intelligences are able to &quot;learn” to execute such tasks by
        simply repeatedly analysing large numbers of labelled examples and
        counterexamples.
        <br>
        Such data is analysed and processed by workers on platforms like Mechanical
        Turks. But little is known about these individuals that complete these tasks.</p> <figure><img src="./interface.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-1tunlep"> <figcaption>Main page of the platform.</figcaption></figure> <quote>“The view is partially blocked by a large hedge/bush of some sort. There
        are large deciduous trees off in the distance, and what appears to be an
        overcast sky. In the far right window pane there is a flowering bush
        with pink flowers.”</quote> <p>On July 02, 2022 I uploaded 200 images on Amazon Mechanical Turkand I
        asked the workers on the platform to describe what they saw. The
        description above is one of the hundreds that I received in less than an
        hour.</p> <div><quote>Houses and trees.</quote></div> <div><quote style="text-align: center; display:block">NICE PHOTO.</quote></div> <div><quote style="text-align: right; display:block">A bike and some trees.  </quote></div> <div><quote style="text-align: center; display:block">GARDEN.</quote></div> <div><quote style="text-align: left; display:block">I see calm days, quiet place with some parked cars.</quote></div> <div><quote style="text-align: right; display:block">car</quote></div> <p>The images that have been described are a result of the same process. On
        June 16, 2022, I started this experiment by asking the workers at Amazon
        Mechanical Turk to send me a photo of their view out of the window and
        the city they live in for $0.20.</p> <p>As organisations use Mechanical Turk to create datasets, in this
        experiment a more private dataset has been created. Following the logic
        of the platform, for a small fee workers have been asked to show a
        glimpse of their private life, their view close to their desk, their
        working station. At the limit of ethics and labour exploitation I asked
        myself whether this is an acceptable approach to use in research and in
        general, if employing random workers around the world is the
        ideal practice to shape future artificial intelligences.</p> <p>While both tasks were performed, the material collected varied
        considerably: from blurred photos to details of curtains, from
        landscapes to computer screenshots.</p> <p>The same consideration can be made with the texts collected. Some
        descriptions are lengthy, others are short, some are tags, others
        instead are just typos. Following the idea that when talking about a
        technology one has to place oneself within it, becoming a &#39;Requester&#39; on
        Amazon Mechanical Turk allowed me to find out more about how the system
        works, the review process and the quality of the data collected.</p> <p>Although much is documented about the demographics of the platform and
        the fact that different payments do not affect the quality of the
        results, these &#39;results&#39; are rarely visible. Most of the data collected
        did not reflect the assigned task. Many results were gibberish, or when
        asked to upload a photo, these were often desktop screenshots, stock
        images, or photos on the computer. These rebellious approaches to the
        platform allow workers to collect their rewards easily and can be
        ignored by requesters. For this reason, such datasets are shown in their
        entirety on this site.</p> <quote>“Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about
        somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediaxted by
        networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in
        physical, material places” (Graham et al., 2015).</quote> <p>Datasets are no exception. The information they carry is a reflection of
        time, politics and geographical contexts.
        <br>
        Although, in the past years, there has been a growing attention of bias studies
        in the field of machine learning, there is still a general disinterest for
        the ones carried by the hidden geographies of datasets. Therefore there is
        a central focus on the geographies of Amazon Mechanical Turk. Not necessarly
        on the demographics of its workers, but rather on the different places where
        data is annotated and created.

        their view out of the window for $0.20. Here are the photos I received
        and the city they were sent from.</h2>

    Before creating an account on the platform, I watched a couple of YouTube
    videos and read on Reddit how to set up tasks. Most of the examples and
    discussions I encountered were about machine learning and the amount of
    money you can earn on Mechanical Turk, and what is the right payment per
    task. On average, Amazon Mechanical Turk pays between $1 and $6 per hour.

    Since I intended to collect photos of the view from workers&#39; windows, I had
    to structure the task and link it to a Google form. Amazon Mechanical Turk
    does not allow photos to be uploaded directly and this is one of the most
    common approaches suggested on Reddit. A Google form allowed participants to
    upload a photo, write their city of origin and their Amazon Mechanical Turk
    ID. This way, after completing the questionnaire, they could receive a
    password to enter into MTurk to get the reward. With the first experiment, I
    collected 203 pictures. The initial goal was 100. More than 50% of the
    images did not comply with the request. In some cases these were broken
    files, in others desktop screenshots, photos of animals or stock images.
    Quite a few entries were duplicated to collect extra rewards.

        platform this time asking for photos of work desks, giving this as an
        example:</p> <figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/oVphOAZ7pHj4qq8gx14SBRoW55DrcPPucsQ-3p4jFmYSSsYPZEivlfe106BQmdcirjJCggSr1zOLPvrR4HcPn3JRsILB4L4FKPYtPkkUJfhrCEnawb7OvLb9ApWTkcHG_IIQSX0T8OtTys8T_VcFqmOtn6tvWw" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-9q0th3"> <figcaption>My reference image.</figcaption></figure> <p>This is the first contribution I received.</p> <figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u/0/drive-viewer/AKGpihat1-geWLTBK7rU1llv0nY-VJlng7nObjrCLeLey-TAB_1o6wuT6FXBXgFylM2PqDhR5Nyp9Vl4qWuN3KXEJsyC05zIFONShCo=w1331-h978-v0" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-9q0th3"> <figcaption>Location: US</figcaption></figure> <p>Again, I asked for 100 images and collected 140 at the end, where the
        extra ones were mainly the example image I provided. By default, Amazon
        Mechanical Turk automatically approves submissions after a period of
        three days. This is probably why most of the material submitted does not
        comply with the task. Quickly completed tasks in order to collect a
        reward that is hopefully not checked. With a dataset of a few hundred
        images, I can check each entry one by one, and in those three days I can
        reject entries that are &#39;wrong&#39; by selecting the specific entry and
        writing a few words in a textarea.</p> <figure><img src="./rejection.png" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-9q0th3"> <figcaption>Screenshot of the rejection form.</figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BKUpKvUYFcbuOopOiwEoRo2_9SOEaybF" alt="Mechanical Turk" class="svelte-9q0th3"> <figcaption>The sample image, or screenshots of it appear multiple times as
            submissions.</figcaption></figure> <p>However, the submitted material remains with me. I can still use it and
        the additional, but inaccurate, data I collect is free work. The review
        process does not seem to be transparent. For all the assignments I have
        refused so far, no worker has ever replied to me asking for an
        explanation. I therefore wonder how many institutions exploit this
        system, refusing payment but continuing to collect tagged data for free.
        At the same time, if usually a third or half of the data collected is
        junk, where does this random content end up?</p> </section></a> <a href="opinions" style="--color-1:#d5ffd2; --color-2:#a79bb4;" class="svelte-qjznvv"><section class="desc svelte-9q0th3" data-svelte-h="svelte-4ok7iq"><h1>Opinions of the workers</h1> <h2>I asked the workers at Amazon Mechanical Turk to share their honest
