"AHV4U78TUUDKI","Approved","Palm Springs, CA USA","I like the work - its relatively easy to do and I can do it on my time. My main issue is having the work available when I have time to do some of it. There are times where there are few HITs to do and its frustrating and a little angering to be honest.","4"
"AVOF14300525D","Approved","Lima, Ohio","I really liked AMT years ago when I first started working for them. However, over the last year or so, this platform has really gone downhill. The hits are not worth my time. Sometimes they only pay a penny or so for work that is over five minutes long! Also, the rejecters seem to randomly reject work. I recently spent about 8 minutes explaining my response to a chatbot conversation, only to get rejected. I have no idea what they wanted. I have a master's, so I can get some good hits. However, these unfair rejections are really starting to add up, and I am worried I will lose my master's status once my rejection rate goes below 99%. What really hurt my rate was a ""mass rejection"" of 10 hits. It turns out that there was a glitch (I read it on MTURKOPTICON), but they would not reverse the rejections. That was so unfair when it was their fault.","2"
"A22KRF782ELLB0","Approved","Murray, KY","I like that I'm able work from home and not have to interact with other people, which helps since I have severe social anxiety. I dislike that the pay is very low. I also dislike that there aren't as many jobs/tasks being posted now as there were a few years ago, which makes it even more difficult to do it for income. The income is also not consistent, so you never really know how much you'll make in a given day or week.","2"
"A2UO3QJZNC2VOE","Approved","Knoxville","I like that there is a place like this to be able to earn some extra money. I have been on here for almost 15 years and I would imagine that I will always use the service. So I like all of that. I wish there were more hits I qualify for sometimes, and that there was a better way to qualify for things. I am not sure how what else to say.","4"
"AUOYNTK0GOFOM","Approved","Lawrence, KS","I value that i get insight into a hige huge variety of important studies and therein I learn some new things. Also, the extra money helps me a lot so overall I'll be positive about M-Turk. It's helped me a LOT over quite a few years by now.","5"

Not a good use of my time, if you ask me. I have better things to do in the time I invested in this thing.","5"
"A1GKEEI844CEKI","Approved","Shelby NC","It has gotten slow over the past three years.  Not as many jobs.  it use to have a lot more.  I could make 300 a week then but now it is much less than that.  I also think the AI devolplment is about done.","4"
"A2EI075XZT9Y2S","Approved","Pittsfield, NH","Lacks any ability to truly hold requesters accountable. For the pay they offer, to unreasonable rejections. Amazon plays no role in defending the worker and leaves it up to us to just deal with it. Can try sending messages to requesters but often ignored. That includes wasting an hour on work to have it crash due to the requesters faulty software.","2"
"ADAGUJNWMEPT6","Approved","Gretna, Louisiana","I like it well enough to have been doing it for more than 15 years, but it does have some real annoyances.  I don't like that bots are allowed to scrape HITs.  I don't like that there is no real repercussion when requesters have design flaws that waste worker time (like surveys with no confirmation code--this happens a LOT).  I also get annoyed that there is sometimes not enough work to do.  Overall, though, I find it a convenient way to supplement my income at times that work for me.","4"
"A1S88VQY8G8CNC","Approved","Herkimer (new york state).","despite some drawbacks; finding out about m-turk is one of the best things that has happened to me.  when i had a job,m-turk earnings were an excellent source of secondary income. now that i am retired, m-turk income, combined with my social security and pension provide me with a relatively comfortable living although i am far from wealthy.  i can do m-turk hits whenever i want; i don't have to worry about my wardrobe; no one is telling me what to do or how to do it.  i like that my approval rating is 99.89 because that tells me i'm doing almost all hits the way they are supposed to be done.  i don't like however, that too many requesters don't seem to know the best ways to produce hits. for example, too many requesters do not allow enough time. these requesters apparently don't know that once time has expired, it can not be extended.  the rates of pay some requesters offer are absurd.  for example, 10 cents for a 10 minute hit.  that is far from acceptable.  when the time that a hit is supposed to take is not even listed.  for example, i might be willing to do a 25 cent hit but i need to know how long the hit will take.","4"
"AKX5RHHO8BIUX","Approved","Saint Paul Minnesota","It's an easy way to earn small amounts of money. I've been doing it for about 13 years, and it helped me pay off my mortgage. On the downside, though, the work can be difficult to find and some of the HITs are tedious.  Amazon doesn't support Turkers at all and so we're pretty much at the mercy of anyone who wants to scam us, steal our work and not pay us.  The work is so variable - definitely feast or famine - and I'm glad I don't rely on it for anything important anymore.","3"

"A26ZENZ5G8AEGM","Approved","Lansdale PA","I like the opportunity to earn money from completing HITs on Amazon Mechanical Turk. I particularly like the academic surveys. I dislike the HITs with very low payments. I dislike when there are a large number of HITs from the same requestor instead of listing all of these HITs under a single post.","4"
"A2J65ZHAJQDKAC","Approved","Spring Lake","I like the platform when things are working and the work is paid.  Unfortunately, there are some hits that reject hits for no reason and we have no way to dispute the issue.  I understand there are millions of hits yearly but if a requestor is being deceitful or has a really low acceptance rate there needs to be an investigation and workers should be made whole.","3"
"A205YOMVOVCUY4","Approved","Denver","On one hand, mturk changed my life. I have C-PTSD and find public places too noisy and stressful. I was on the verge of becoming completely homeless but went back to working on here (I previously worked a lot on here when in college but then took a break). It now gives me a chance to earn enough money to survive. On the other hand, it's a terrible way to make a living. It's not stable and can be stressful. I have found that working on other platforms and bouncing back and forth between them helps so there isn't as much down time waiting for work.","3"

"A23THREOGHZVDF","Submitted","GURGAON , INDIA","what i like about AMT is that it gives me the option to work remotely from home . all i need is a PC with internet connection. second thing i like is atleast some work is available throughout the day, so i can work when ever i feel like. third thing i like is i get payed in US dollars which are equivalent of huge amount of Indian rupees. what i don't like is that whenever after getting a rejection i try to contact requester most of the times they don't reply at all. that is so unprofessional attitude. second thing i hate is that most work is available to US citizens only . i think even indian workers are of same  competency. one honest suggestion of mine is instead of focussing only on micro gigs , AMT should also provide bigger assignment options as well. also, if AMT can also cover transaction fees and annual maintenance fee of payment processors like hyperwallet and payoneer then we can see some real earnings entering our bank accounts and would give workers a lot of mental peace and would truly increase the bonding between AMT and it's workers.","5"

I like how there seem to always be one or two HITs where you can go in most hours of the day and be able to choose a lower-paying survey so that you aren't completely wasting your time.
