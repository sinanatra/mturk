    <h1>Views of the working desk</h1>

        Like the first experiment, I recreated a similar approach after more
        than a year.

    <p>I asked for photos of work desks, giving this as an example:</p>

    <p>This is the first contribution I received.</p>

        Again, I asked for 100 images and collected 140 at the end, where the
        extra ones were mainly the example image I provided. By default, Amazon
        Mechanical Turk automatically approves submissions after a period of
        three days. This is probably why most of the material submitted does not
        comply with the task. Quickly completed tasks in order to collect a
        reward that is hopefully not checked. With a dataset of a few hundred
        images, I can check each entry one by one, and in those three days I can
        reject entries that are 'wrong' by selecting the specific entry and
        writing a few words in a textarea.

        />
        <figcaption>
            The sample image, or screenshots of it appear multiple times as
            submissions.

    <p>
        However, the submitted material remains with me. I can still use it and
        the additional, but inaccurate, data I collect is free work. The review
        process does not seem to be transparent. For all the assignments I have
        refused so far, no worker has ever replied to me asking for an
        explanation. I therefore wonder how many institutions exploit this
        system, refusing payment but continuing to collect tagged data for free.
        At the same time, if usually a third or half of the data collected is
        junk, where does this random content end up?
