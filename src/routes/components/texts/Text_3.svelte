    <h1>An attempt at exhausting a dataset</h1>
    <h2>
        As in the broken phone game, I repeated the process several times. I
        uploaded the pictures received from the first task into the platform and
        asked the new workers to describe them. I then took these descriptions
        and asked new workers to draw a picture of them.
    </h2>

    <p>
        As an attempt to see how information gets lost, some drawings vary
        considerably from the initial image.

    <p>Some outputs took a romantic direction:</p>

        In other cases, probably being used to tagging datasets, many
        descriptions captured only some objects in an image, and in some cases
        the drawings became texts.
